Verse 1:
Wake up early, seize the day
Take the chance, don’t look away
One shot only, don’t delay
Make it count, find your way
Step by step, you pave the road
Carry strength, lighten the load

Chorus:
Push yourself, don’t let go
Every moment, let it show
Dreams are waiting, let them flow
This is your time, let it grow
Fight the fear, embrace the fight
Shine your light through darkest night
